# Gene expression model of high-risk multiple myeloma
This document outlines the gene expression model for high-risk multiple myeloma based on the study by Shaughnessy et al. (PMID: 17105813). The study identified 70 genes associated with early disease-related death, with 30% mapping to chromosome 1 (P < .001). These genes were used to calculate risk scores for samples.
## Gene List
The following is the list of 70 genes identified in the study, used for risk score calculation.

## Notes
The 70 genes listed above were identified as linked to early disease-related death.

Approximately 30% of these genes map to chromosome 1 (P < .001).

The risk score for each sample can be computed using gene expression data, though the exact methodology depends on your dataset and implementation.
