   abstract = {T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a clonal malignancy of immature T cells. Recently, the next-generation sequencing approach has allowed systematic identification of molecular features in pediatric T-ALL. Here, by performing RNA-sequencing and other genomewide analysis, we investigated the genomic landscape in 61 adult and 69 pediatric T-ALL cases. Thirty-six distinct gene fusion transcripts were identified, with SET-NUP214 being highly related to adult cases. Among 18 previously unknown fusions, ZBTB16-ABL1, TRA-SALL2, and involvement of NKX2-1 were recurrent events. ZBTB16-ABL1 functioned as a leukemogenic driver and responded to the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Among 48 genes with mutation rates >3%, 6 were newly found in T-ALL. An aberrantly overexpressed short mRNA transcript of the SLC17A9 gene was revealed in most cases with overexpressed TAL1, which predicted a poor prognosis in the adult group. Up-regulation of HOXA, MEF2C, and LYL1 was often present in adult cases, while TAL1 overexpression was detected mainly in the pediatric group. Although most gene fusions were mutually exclusive, they coexisted with gene mutations. These genetic abnormalities were correlated with deregulated gene expression markers in three subgroups. This study may further enrich the current knowledge of T-ALL molecular pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy of T cell progenitors, known to be a heterogeneous disease in pediatric and adult patients. Here we attempted to better understand the disease at the molecular level based on the transcriptomic landscape of 707 T-ALL patients (510 pediatric, 190 adult patients, and 7 with unknown age; 599 from published cohorts and 108 newly investigated). Leveraging the information of gene expression enabled us to identify 10 subtypes (G1-G10), including the previously undescribed one characterized by GATA3 mutations, with GATA3R276Q capable of affecting lymphocyte development in zebrafish. Through associating with T cell differentiation stages, we found that high expression of LYL1/LMO2/SPI1/HOXA (G1-G6) might represent the early T cell progenitor, pro/precortical/cortical stage with a relatively high age of disease onset, and lymphoblasts with TLX3/TLX1 high expression (G7-G8) could be blocked at the cortical/postcortical stage, while those with high expression of NKX2-1/TAL1/LMO1 (G9-G10) might correspond to cortical/postcortical/mature stages of T cell development. Notably, adult patients harbored more cooperative mutations among epigenetic regulators, and genes involved in JAK-STAT and RAS signaling pathways, with 44% of patients aged 40 y or above in G1 bearing DNMT3A/IDH2 mutations usually seen in acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting the nature of mixed phenotype acute leukemia.},

   abstract = {Most B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) can be classified into known major genetic subtypes, while a substantial proportion of BCP ALL remains poorly characterized in relation to its underlying genomic abnormalities. We therefore initiated a large-scale international study to reanalyze and delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 BCP ALL cases using RNA sequencing. Fourteen BCP ALL gene expression subgroups (G1 to G14) were identified. Apart from extending eight previously described subgroups (G1 to G8 associated with MEF2D fusions, TCF3-PBX1 fusions, ETV6-RUNX1-positive/ETV6-RUNX1-like, DUX4 fusions, ZNF384 fusions, BCR-ABL1/Ph-like, high hyperdiploidy, and KMT2A fusions), we defined six additional gene expression subgroups: G9 was associated with both PAX5 and CRLF2 fusions; G10 and G11 with mutations in PAX5 (p.P80R) and IKZF1 (p.N159Y), respectively; G12 with IGH-CEBPE fusion and mutations in ZEB2 (p.H1038R); and G13 and G14 with TCF3/4-HLF and NUTM1 fusions, respectively. In pediatric BCP ALL, subgroups G2 to G5 and G7 (51 to 65/67 chromosomes) were associated with low-risk, G7 (with </=50 chromosomes) and G9 were intermediate-risk, whereas G1, G6, and G8 were defined as high-risk subgroups. In adult BCP ALL, G1, G2, G6, and G8 were associated with high risk, while G4, G5, and G7 had relatively favorable outcomes. This large-scale transcriptome sequence analysis of BCP ALL revealed distinct molecular subgroups that reflect discrete pathways of BCP ALL, informing disease classification and prognostic stratification. The combined results strongly advocate that RNA sequencing be introduced into the clinical diagnostic workup of BCP ALL.},

   abstract = {Genomic landscapes of 92 adult and 111 pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were investigated using next-generation sequencing and copy number alteration analysis. Recurrent gene mutations and fusions were tested in an additional 87 adult and 93 pediatric patients. Among the 29 newly identified in-frame gene fusions, those involving MEF2D and ZNF384 were clinically relevant and were demonstrated to perturb B-cell differentiation, with EP300-ZNF384 inducing leukemia in mice. Eight gene expression subgroups associated with characteristic genetic abnormalities were identified, including leukemia with MEF2D and ZNF384 fusions in two distinct clusters. In subgroup G4 which was characterized by ERG deletion, DUX4-IGH fusion was detected in most cases. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to compare the features of molecular pathogenesis between adult and pediatric B-ALL and to identify signatures possibly related to the inferior outcome of adults to that of children. We found that, besides the known discrepancies in frequencies of prognostic markers, adult patients had more cooperative mutations and greater enrichment for alterations of epigenetic modifiers and genes linked to B-cell development, suggesting difference in the target cells of transformation between adult and pediatric patients and may explain in part the disparity in their responses to treatment.},
