Organogenesis in mammals is a grand symphony of life in which every note must be struck at the precise moment and in the exact place. Across a developmental window that lasts only days, populations of seemingly uniform progenitor cells proliferate, migrate, and rearrange themselves into the elaborate three-dimensional architectures of heart, brain, liver, lung, kidney, and pancreas. These morphogenetic events are not autonomous mechanical routines; rather, they are driven by tightly interwoven transcriptional programs and metabolic fluxes that evolve in both space and time. Although decades of research have catalogued individual signaling cascades and metabolic reactions, the higher-order principles that coordinate transcriptional logic with biochemical energy and building-block supply remain elusive.

To illuminate this coordination, we generated high-resolution spatiotemporal transcriptional networks that chart how regulatory information is dispatched across embryonic space. By sampling embryos at closely spaced intervals and preserving spatial context throughout RNA capture, we reconstructed dynamic gene-regulatory maps that reveal when and where cohorts of transcription factors converge to switch developmental modules on or off. Simultaneously, we created a comprehensive metabolic atlas by imaging and quantifying hundreds of metabolites across the same anatomical coordinates. This dual atlas allowed us to observe, for the first time, how metabolic landscapes expand, contract, and shift chemical composition as organs take shape.

Rather than treating metabolism as a mere provider of ATP and carbon skeletons, our integrative analysis uncovered bidirectional communication between transcriptional states and metabolic microenvironments. Ephemeral changes in nutrient availability and redox balance are sensed and transduced into chromatin-level modifications that, in turn, reinforce or repress transcriptional programs. Conversely, waves of transcriptional activity remodel metabolic pathways to match the biosynthetic and energetic demands of each emerging tissue domain. Through this iterative feedback, transcription and metabolism become co-authors of morphogenesis, jointly dictating the pace, direction, and resolution of developmental patterning.
