title: "Spatiotemporal Metabolic Atlas of Mammalian Organogenesis" 
---

Organogenesis in mammals involves a highly orchestrated series of spatially and temporally regulated cellular processes. These processes are tightly coupled to transcriptional networks and metabolic pathways, but how these factors cooperately drive complex morphogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we constructed spatiotemporal transcriptional networks and a comprehensive metabolic atlas to delineate the dynamic metabolic landscape during organogenesis.
