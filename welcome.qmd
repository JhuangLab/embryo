# Welcome {.unnumbered}
This work presents a comprehensive analysis of embryonic development, a significant undertaking that also represents my first public release of all project code. This commitment to open science aims to maximize accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. I acknowledge that further refinement of the codebase is possible, and I actively solicit feedback to enhance our scientific methods and computational tools. This repository will be updated to incorporate new methodologies as our research progresses.

## Reproducible research
A primary objective of this work is to empower readers to reproduce our findings. We aspire for researchers, particularly those in genomics and bioinformatics, to be able to replicate the majority of our reported results. Given the critical importance of reproducibility in these fields, we have prioritized its implementation throughout the project. A companion resource will detail our comprehensive bioinformatics workflows, encompassing data preprocessing, analytical pipelines, specific software versions, and parameter configurations. This dedicated support is intended to ensure maximum transparency and enable precise replication of our computational methods.
