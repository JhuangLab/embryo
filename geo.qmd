# Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

We conducted a search using the keyword "Multiple Myeloma" in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, accessible at [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The search primarily returned microarray datasets, which provided valuable gene expression profiles for our study. Among the results, we identified six RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, with accession numbers GSE116324, GSE230526, GSE263767, GSE148048, GSE164652, GSE220144, that were particularly relevant to our research objectives. These RNA-seq datasets have been successfully incorporated into our study, offering critical genomic and phenomic data to advance our understanding of Multiple Myeloma.

Additionally, we utilized the microarray datasets retrieved from GEO as a validation resource in our study. These datasets served as a complementary tool to confirm our findings, enhancing the robustness of our analyses.
