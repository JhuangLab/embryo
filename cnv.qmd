## Jilin CNVs
We applied RNAseqCNV to infer arm-level copy number variation (CNV) from bulk RNA-seq samples. For single-cell RNA-seq data, inferCNV was used to estimate CNV profiles at the individual cell level. We observed a degree of concordance between CNV patterns and transcriptomic features, and utilized one of the most prominent CNV-associated expression signatures to define an internal subtype within the HRD group.

## CoMMpass CNVs
In addition, for the CoMMpass dataset, CNV profiles previously reported in published studies were collected and used for comparison. The results demonstrated a high level of concordance in overall CNV trends between our inferences and external data sources.

A summary of the inferred CNV landscape is shown in the following figure:
